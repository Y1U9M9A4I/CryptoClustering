# CryptoClustering Assignment 

In this assignment, we are tasked with using Python and unsupervised learning to predict whether cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. 

Through a comparison of K-means through original data use versus PCA Analysis, we are able to demonstrate the impact of using fewer features to cluster data using K-Means. We use both the Elbow method and cluster charts to demonstrate these effects. 

Used languages and packages include: 
Python 
Panda 
Sklearn - KMeans
Sklearn - PCA
